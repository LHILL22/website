As my M.Res. Stats course is slowly morphing into a broader course on reproducibilty, data science, and statistics for psychologists, I thought it would be helpful (possibly for my future self) to add a link here to the 2018-2019 iteration of the course.

All the material can be downloaded from the following repo:

https://github.com/ajstewartlang/Psychology_MRes_Stats_R_Course

In the repo itself, click on the __'Clone or download'__ button in the top right to download the zipped version of the repository.

Each folder contains the slides in .pdf form for the first half of each session, the R script that goes with those slides, and the lab worksheet for the second half as an .html file. All data files for the lectures and the lab classes are included.
