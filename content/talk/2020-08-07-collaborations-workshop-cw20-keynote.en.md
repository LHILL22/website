I was hugely honoured to be invited to deliver the opening keynote on Open Research and Reproducibilty at the Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop (CW20). The event was originally planned to be held at Queens University Belfast, but was switched to being a virtual meeting due to the Covid-19 situation. The organisers did an amazing job creating a fantastic online conference. The talks were all recorded and are available to (re)watch on the [SSI channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyCTqrsz0DKcimH81z7VnQg). If you are interested in hearing my keynote talk you can view it [here](https://youtu.be/uLNcsL5fA44).
