In the summer of 2020 I started recording a bunch of workshops as part of two of the Masters level courses I teach at the University of Manchester. I realised they might have broader interest so I decided to share a subset of them via a website. Hopefully you will find them useful. No previous R experience is expected and I take you through all the stages (right from the basics of installing R and RStudio Desktop) step-by-step. 

Just click on the image below to go to the workshops.

All of the material in the workshops was created using open source where possible using an [Entroware Apollo laptop](https://www.entroware.com/store/) running [GNU/Linux distro Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). The audio was captured with a [Fifine USB Podcasting microphone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Condenser-Microphone-Recording-Interface-Power-K669/dp/B01N034RTC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=141Z8ED4VGCVD&dchild=1&keywords=fifine+usb+podcast+condenser+microphone&qid=1594989611&sprefix=fifne+usb%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFFMzAxOE5DUDJIREwmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA4MzA2NjIxVU40MlhNMFNCTDhWJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5NDI2OTQxOFY0R002UVJBS1AzJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) and the video with a [Razer Kiyo webcam](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Razer-Streaming-Adjustable-Brightness-Microphone/dp/B076QK6489/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=razer+kiyo&qid=1594989677&sr=8-3). The audio and video were recorded using [Open Broadcast Software](https://obsproject.com/) and edited using [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/). If you are interested in learning more about open source software, you might be interested in having a look at [this set of resources](https://ajstewartlang.github.io/24_open_source/knitted_workshop/24_open_source.html) I have put together.
